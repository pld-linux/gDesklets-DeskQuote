1. Introduction
-----------------------------
This program used to be called DeskTao and display Quotes on your desktop. 
From this release it is renamed DeskQuotes and comes as a seperate Sensor 
and Display, you can use the default DeskTao display or construct a custom 
one as you wish.

This is DeskQuotes, a sensor to return random quotes from a file to a
gdesklets display on your desktop. It will return quotes from any properly
formatted file (similar to fortune files).

Although this program works a little like a traditional fortune program
there are some differences with the format of the source text file and the
search program is less efficient (i.e. more basic), it is however very
simple and should work on any system and you won't need to run any extra 
indexing functions on customised quote files you may want to use.

 The processor usage is higher than I would like, but then again I use 
update times of around once every five minutes, so it's not an issue! If 
you really want to update the quote every 10 seconds it's your call, but 
you'll take a performance hit!!

Please bare with me, this is my first Python program!

2. File formats
--------------------
The file format is similar to a fortune file, the header consists of:

  First line - 	Delimiter
  Second line - File Description
  Third Line - 	Number of lines counting from 0 to the DELIMITER AT THE 
		END OF THE SECOND TO LAST QUOTE!!
  Forth Line -	Delimiter again
  Then your quotes, separated by delimiters.
  AND A FINAL DELIMITER

So a complete file will look like this:
------------------------------------------
%
Quotes from the Tao, S.Mitchel translation.
10
%
I

The tao that can be told
is not the eternal Tao
The name that can be named
is not the eternal Name.
%
The last quote
%
------------------------------------------
   				...etc

3. Installation
-------------------
 Run the script,  
 Once the program is installed, go to the directory containing your 
DeskQuotes display and type 'gdesklets displayname.desklet' and you 
 should be up and running.


4. How to use it
-----------------------

 The program will run in it's default mode at first. You can use the 
configuration dialog to alter:

  A. The Font and it's colour. If you're center aligning i'd recommend a 
	courier or monotype font to get reasonable looking results

  B. The time between refreshing the quote. The program is quite 
processor-intensive when it's parsing through the file and fetching your 
quote, but then again if you do it once every 10 minutes you shouldn't 
notice.

  C. The quotefile. The file that comes with the tao display is called
'tao' and used by default. Read the formatting advice above and create
your own themed display. Send it to me and i'll put it on the website for
others to download.

  D. Lenght of line. Obviously different font sizes will take up more or 
less room. This option will allow you to alter the length of individual 
lines returned by DeskTao to get eye-pleasing results.

  E. Text alignment, as I wrote above, if using centering than choose a 
monospace font for best results. If alignment ever gets built into 
gdesklets i'll change this!
